# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in gitlawb, please **do not open a public issue**.

Report it privately by emailing **security@gitlawb.com** with:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- (Optional) Suggested fix

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to release a fix within 14 days for critical issues.

## Current Security Architecture

### Current live security controls

**Ed25519 identity and HTTP Signatures**
- Every write operation is signed with RFC 9421 HTTP Signatures
- Full Ed25519 signature verification on every authenticated request
- Keys are stored as PKCS#8 PEM files with 0600 permissions
- DIDs are derived deterministically from the public key (did:key)

**Content addressing**
- Every git object is content-addressed via CIDv1 (SHA-256)
- Tamper-evident by construction — a modified object changes its CID

**UCAN token validation**
- Bootstrap UCAN tokens are issued at registration.
- A supplied token's signature, audience, expiry, and proof-chain attenuation are validated.
- Tokens use a signed JSON wire format with expiry.
- Capability grants are not yet consulted by repository write authorization; see the limitations below.

**Smart contracts (Base Sepolia testnet)**
- `GitlawbDIDRegistry` — on-chain DID → document registry
- `GitlawbNameRegistry` — human name → DID registry
- Both auditable on-chain, no admin keys

## Dependency Vulnerability Status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Dependabot alerts | Current open Rust alerts were addressed by updating vulnerable dependencies, removing libp2p mDNS, and moving P2P transport from TCP/Yamux to QUIC/UDP. |

## Known Limitations

These are documented limitations of the current live release. They should be prioritized without breaking existing nodes during rolling upgrades.

### Repository write authorization defaults
- `git-receive-pack` verifies HTTP Signatures, but `GITLAWB_ENFORCE_OWNER_PUSH` defaults to `false` for compatibility during rollout.
- **Impact:** With the default setting, a valid signature authenticates the pusher but does not require that DID to be the repository owner.
- **Mitigation:** Set `GITLAWB_ENFORCE_OWNER_PUSH=true` on nodes where owner-only pushes are required. Confirm that every legitimate pusher uses the owner DID before enabling it.

### UCAN delegation and revocation
- The middleware validates a supplied UCAN's complete proof chain, but a root token is accepted without an independently trusted issuer anchor. `Ucan::can` is not yet used by write handlers, so a UCAN does not grant scoped repository access.
- Agent lifecycle revocation is not checked by HTTP Signature authorization. Removing or revoking an agent record does not itself block a compromised DID from authenticating.
- **Impact:** Do not use UCANs for collaborator permissions or rely on agent-record revocation as a key-compromise response.
- **Mitigation:** Keep sensitive deployments behind operational network controls and enable owner-only push enforcement where it fits the deployment until trusted delegation and authorization-aware revocation are implemented.

### git-receive-pack authentication
- The `git-receive-pack` endpoint enforces HTTP Signature auth. Plain Git smart-HTTP clients do not generate those headers, so the `git-remote-gitlawb` helper is required for pushes.
- **Impact:** Direct HTTP pushes without RFC 9421 headers are rejected; users need `gitlawb://` remotes or equivalent signed clients.
- **Mitigation:** Use `gitlawb://` remote URLs and keep `git-remote-gitlawb` on the user's `PATH`.
- **Fix target:** v0.2

### Private repository reads
- Repository and path-scoped visibility checks are enforced for repository API and Git content reads. A denied whole-repository or root read returns the same 404 shape as a missing repository, so the denial does not reveal private-repository existence.
- Sparse-clone support exposes withheld path globs to callers who may read the repository root. Do not put sensitive information in withheld path names.
- `GET /api/v1/tasks`, `/api/v1/ipfs/pins`, and `/api/v1/arweave/anchors` are not repository-gated. Task records include a UCAN token; pin and anchor listings expose object and ref metadata.
- Changing a repository's visibility controls future serving, but cannot retract ref metadata or configured external pins and anchors already announced while the repository was public. Do not push secrets to an announceable repository.
- **Impact:** Visibility policies protect the repository and Git content routes they gate, not every metadata endpoint or previously published content.
- **Remaining boundary:** This read control does not address the independent write-authorization and UCAN-delegation limitations described above.

### Pull-request review enforcement
- Pull-request review comments are not yet threaded or line-anchored, and merges do not enforce required approvals.
- **Impact:** Teams must use their own review policy or external controls for merge approval requirements.

### GraphQL mutation coverage
- Existing GraphQL mutations require an authenticated signer, but a mutation-specific source-level guardrail has not yet been added for future mutations.
- **Impact:** A new mutation could accidentally omit its signer check without an explicit test fence.

### Peer route hardening rollout
- Peer announce and sync notification routes accept signed requests and verify DID matches when a signature is present.
- **Impact:** Unsigned peer writes are still accepted by default so existing live nodes can keep communicating during rolling upgrades.
- **Mitigation:** After all active peers run signed-node builds, operators can set `GITLAWB_REQUIRE_SIGNED_PEER_WRITES=true`.
- **Fix target:** staged rollout

## Threat Model

gitlawb is designed to be secure against:
- **Unauthenticated writes** — HTTP Signature auth on protected write endpoints; see Known Limitations for owner and capability authorization gaps
- **Tampered git objects** — CIDv1 content addressing detects modification
- **Identity spoofing** — DIDs derived from public keys, unforgeable without the private key
- **Centralized takedown** — no single point of control; data on IPFS + Arweave

gitlawb is **not yet** designed to defend against:
- A compromised node operator (node operators are trusted for their own node)
- Sybil attacks on the DHT (trust score system mitigates, not eliminates)
- Timing attacks on signature verification (not constant-time compared in v0.1)
