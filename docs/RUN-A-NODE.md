# Running a gitlawb node

Step-by-step guide to staking $GITLAWB, registering your node on-chain, and earning protocol fees as a PoS operator.

---

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with at least **10,000 $GITLAWB** (minimum stake) plus a small amount of ETH on Base for gas
- Docker or Rust 1.91+ (for running the node process)
- A public HTTP URL (your-host.com) — can be a VPS, Fly.io app, or anything reachable. A Fly.io config is provided at `infra/fly/fly.toml` (deploy from the repo root with `fly deploy -c infra/fly/fly.toml`)

---

## 1. Install the CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gitlawb.com/install.sh | sh
# or build from source:
cargo install --path crates/gl
```

## 2. Create a gitlawb identity

Every node is identified by an Ed25519 DID keypair:

```bash
gl identity new
gl identity show
# → did:key:z6Mk...
```

This is your **node DID** — it's distinct from your Ethereum wallet.

## 3. Register your node on-chain

This stakes $GITLAWB and links your node DID to your operator wallet:

```bash
export GITLAWB_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_KEY
export GITLAWB_TOKEN=0x5F980Dcfc4c0fa3911554cf5ab288ed0eb13DBa3
export GITLAWB_CONTRACT_NODE_STAKING=0xNODE_STAKING_ADDR
export GITLAWB_CHAIN_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org

gl node register \
  --stake 10000 \
  --http-url https://my-node.example.com
```

What this does:
1. Checks your $GITLAWB balance
2. Calls `token.approve(NodeStaking, 10000e18)` if needed
3. Calls `NodeStaking.registerNode(didHash, httpUrl, 10000e18)`
4. Transfers 10,000 $GITLAWB into escrow

## 4. Run the node

### Option A — Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name gitlawb-node \
  -p 7545:7545 \
  -p 7546:7546/udp \
  -v gitlawb-data:/data \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/gitlawb \
  -e GITLAWB_PUBLIC_URL=https://my-node.example.com \
  -e GITLAWB_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=$GITLAWB_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  -e GITLAWB_CONTRACT_NODE_STAKING=$GITLAWB_CONTRACT_NODE_STAKING \
  -e GITLAWB_CHAIN_RPC_URL=$GITLAWB_CHAIN_RPC_URL \
  -e GITLAWB_OPERATOR_STRICT_MODE=true \
  ghcr.io/gitlawb/node:latest
```

### Option B — docker-compose

See [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml) — bundles node + Postgres.

### Option C — From source

```bash
cargo run -p gitlawb-node --release
```

Required env for on-chain PoS mode:
- `GITLAWB_CONTRACT_NODE_STAKING` — contract address
- `GITLAWB_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` — key that posts heartbeats
- `GITLAWB_CHAIN_RPC_URL` — Base RPC URL (default Sepolia)

Optional:
- `GITLAWB_OPERATOR_STRICT_MODE=true` — refuse to start if not registered or not currently active
- `GITLAWB_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_HOURS=20` — how often to post heartbeats (must be < 24)

## 5. Verify

```bash
gl node onchain-status
```

Expected output:
```
On-chain status for did:key:z6Mk...

  Operator wallet:  0x...
  Staked:           10000 $GITLAWB
  HTTP URL:         https://my-node.example.com
  Last heartbeat:   1760000000 (unix)
  Active flag:      true
  Currently active: true
  Pending rewards:  0 $GITLAWB
```

Check your node logs — you should see `operator heartbeat loop starting` and a heartbeat tx within a few seconds of startup.

## 6. Earn rewards

The node's heartbeat loop runs every 20 hours. As long as you stay active:
- Every Sunday, the `FeeDistributor` distributes accumulated fees.
- 75% of the weekly pot is split across all active nodes (pro-rata by stake).
- Your share accrues as `pendingRewards` on-chain — claim anytime without unstaking.

```bash
gl node claim
```

## 7. Unstake (if you want out)

7-day cooldown, two steps:

```bash
# Step 1: request unstake (starts 7-day timer)
gl node unstake-request

# ... wait 7 days ...

# Step 2: complete — returns stake + any pending rewards
gl node unstake
```

During the cooldown your node still earns rewards if it keeps heartbeating.

## Owner-only push

The node requires the authenticated pusher to be the repo owner on **every**
branch. A push whose authenticated DID is not the repo owner is rejected with
HTTP 403 before any ref update is applied. The owner is matched in both the full
`did:key:z6Mk…` form and its bare `z6Mk…` suffix.

This is on by default, and the default is the point. The node authenticates every
`git-receive-pack` push with a valid RFC 9421 `did:key` signature, but `did:key`
is self-certifying: any party can generate a key, derive its DID and sign.
Authentication is not authorization, so without this gate every signed caller can
push to every repository — private ones included — on any branch that is not
explicitly protected.

### Turning it off

```bash
GITLAWB_ENFORCE_OWNER_PUSH=false
```

Both the environment variable and `--enforce-owner-push false` disable it; the
bare `--enforce-owner-push` flag still means `true`.

Do this only for a rolling upgrade whose pushers are not yet the repo owner, and
treat it as temporary: while it is off, your node accepts a push to any repository
from anyone who can generate a keypair.

### Caution: delegated and CI keys are non-owners

Push authorization is owner-only today. A UCAN `git/push` capability is verified
but **not yet honored for authorization**, so a delegated key cannot push while
this gate is on, even when it holds a valid capability for the repo.

If your automation pushes under its own DID rather than the owner's, it will start
getting 403s. Either have it push as the owner, or set
`GITLAWB_ENFORCE_OWNER_PUSH=false` until scoped collaborator / UCAN-delegated push
rights land — that work is what removes this trade-off.

## Operational checklist

| Concern | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Heartbeat gas | ~$0.03/month on Base L2 — negligible |
| Missed heartbeats | After 3 days without one, you're excluded from rewards until you beat again |
| Operator key | Dedicated wallet, small ETH balance, not your main treasury |
| Monitoring | Watch `lastHeartbeat` on-chain; alert if > 22h since last beat |
| Public URL | Must resolve and serve `/health` for liveness and DB-aware `/ready` for peer readiness |
| Rolling upgrade (advisory-lock algorithm) | The SHA-256 advisory-lock key swap (replacing `DefaultHasher`) re-keys every repo in the first release that carries it. During a shared-Postgres rolling upgrade, old nodes compute a different `i64` key than new nodes for the same repo, so PostgreSQL treats them as independent locks and cross-machine write-exclusion is lost. **Drain in-flight writes** or cut over through a **single node** before bringing new-binary nodes online. |

## Troubleshooting

**"insufficient $GITLAWB balance"** — fund the operator wallet with at least 10,000 $GITLAWB.

**Node refuses to start with "strict-mode operator check failed"** — either `gl node register` first, or unset `GITLAWB_OPERATOR_STRICT_MODE`.

**Node refuses to start with "GITLAWB_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS (20) must be at least max_concurrent_git_pushes (32) + 8 headroom"**: raise `GITLAWB_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` to at least the push cap plus 8 (40 with the default cap of 32; 48 is the shipped default and the recommended value), or lower `GITLAWB_MAX_CONCURRENT_GIT_PUSHES`. This bites a node upgraded in place that still sets the old pool size of 20. The check is deliberate: each concurrent push pins one pooled connection for its whole receive-pack, so a pool that does not clear the push cap lets a burst of slow pushes starve every other database path.

**Rewards are 0 after a week** — run `gl node onchain-status`. If `currentlyActive: false`, check your heartbeat loop (node logs for `operator heartbeat sent`).

**Want to rotate operator wallet** — requires unstake → re-register with new wallet. No in-place rotation in v1.
