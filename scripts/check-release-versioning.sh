# Release-versioning coverage gate for the workspace crates.
#
# release-please owns every crate's version. It rewrites a version line only
# when BOTH halves hold: the line carries an `# x-release-please-version`
# annotation, and the crate's manifest is listed under `extra-files` in
# release-please-config.json. A crate missing either half is silently skipped
# at release time and freezes at whatever version it was created with, which
# is exactly what happened to icaptcha-client (added as a workspace member
# after the config was last written, so it sat at 0.4.0 while the rest of the
# workspace walked to 0.7.1 across four releases).
#
# Exhaustive-by-construction: the required set is DERIVED from the workspace
# member list via `cargo metadata`, never from a hand-maintained list here. A
# newly added crate reds CI whether or not anyone remembered this gate exists,
# which is the property a hand list cannot have.
#
# Hard-fail directions, all three release-silent:
#   1. a workspace member absent from extra-files
#   2. a workspace member whose version line lacks the annotation
#   3. an extra-files entry pointing at a manifest that no longer exists
#
# Runnable from anywhere in the repo.
