# Dependency-purity gate for the `gitlawb-core` crate.
#
# gitlawb-core is embedded by every consumer (the gl CLI, git-remote-gitlawb,
# the node daemon), so it must stay lean. This script recomputes gitlawb-core's
# NORMAL (non-dev, non-build) transitive dependency set and fails if it contains
# any crate not present in ci/gitlawb-core-allowed-deps.txt.
#
# Hard-fail direction: a crate present now but NOT allowlisted. That is the case
# the gate exists to catch (core silently gaining a heavy dependency).
# Informational only: an allowlisted crate no longer present (stale entry) — a
# legitimate dependency removal should not red CI, so it is reported, not failed.
#
# Runnable from anywhere in the repo.

# dependency closure gained something unallowlisted, and a stale Cargo.lock
# would red it for a reason that has nothing to do with that closure. Lock
# staleness is already caught by the --locked cargo jobs, so it does not need a
# second gate here.

# it: this check must never leave the working tree dirty when run locally.
