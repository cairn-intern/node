# gitlawb node on AWS (Terraform)

Single EC2 instance running the published node image + Postgres via Docker
compose, with a persistent encrypted EBS volume, Elastic IP, SSM access, and
daily snapshots.

```text
Elastic IP ──► EC2 t4g.small (Amazon Linux 2023, arm64)
  7545/tcp       docker compose:
  7546/udp        ├─ node      (ghcr.io/gitlawb/node, pulled — not built)
                  └─ postgres:16-alpine
                 EBS gp3 volume mounted at /mnt/data
                  ├─ node/   → container /data (repos + identity key)
                  └─ postgres/ → postgres data dir
```

## Prerequisites

- Terraform ≥ 1.6
- AWS credentials configured (`aws sts get-caller-identity` works)
- AWS CLI + [Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) (for shell access)
- A default VPC in the target region (or pass `subnet_id`)

## Quick start

```sh
cd infra/aws
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # edit: public_url at minimum
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply    # ⚠ creates billable resources (~$25/mo: EC2 + EBS + snapshots)
```

After apply (~3-5 min for first boot to pull images and start):

```sh
curl "$(terraform output -raw api_url)/health"
```

## ⚠ First boot: back up the identity key

The node generates `/data/keys/identity.pem` on first start — it defines the
node's DID. **Losing it permanently changes the node's identity.** Back it up
immediately:

```sh
$(terraform output -raw ssm_session_command)
# in the session:
sudo cat /mnt/data/node/keys/identity.pem
```

Store the key somewhere safe (password manager / offline). The volume's
`prevent_destroy` guard and daily DLM snapshots protect against accidents, but
are not a substitute for an offline backup.

## Shell access

SSM Session Manager — no SSH port, no keys to manage:

```sh
$(terraform output -raw ssm_session_command)
```

Bootstrap log: `/var/log/gitlawb-bootstrap.log`. Stack lives in `/opt/gitlawb`
(`docker compose ps`, `docker compose logs node`).

SSH is off by default; set `ssh_ingress_cidr` + `ssh_key_name` if you need it.

## Building and pushing the image (ECR mode)

With `create_ecr_repo = true` the instance pulls from a private ECR repo in
this account instead of an external registry (the instance role gets pull
rights via the amazon-ecr-credential-helper). Build from the repo root —
arm64 to match t4g (native on Apple Silicon):

```sh
ECR_URL=$(terraform -chdir=infra/aws output -raw ecr_repository_url)
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "${ECR_URL%%/*}"
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t "$ECR_URL:latest" .
docker push "$ECR_URL:latest"
```

Then run the upgrade command (below) to roll it out.

## Upgrading the node

User-data only runs at first boot, so upgrades go through SSM:

```sh
$(terraform output -raw upgrade_command)
```

This reinstalls the rendered `/opt/gitlawb/compose.yaml`, then runs
`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` on the instance.

**Run `terraform apply` before the upgrade command.** The command is an SSM
document managed by Terraform, and it embeds the compose file rendered from your
current variables. An instance that has not had a fresh `apply` still holds the
previous document and will reinstall the previous compose file.

- With `image_tag = "latest"` (default) that picks up the newest release.
- With a **pinned tag**, set `image_tag` in `terraform.tfvars` and `apply` — the
  rendered compose carries it, so the upgrade installs the right version.
- **`compose.yaml` is Terraform-owned and is overwritten on every upgrade.**
  Per-instance settings belong in `/opt/gitlawb/.env`, which is never touched.
- **The upgrade reconciles the service set, not just the image.** The rendering is
  conditional — `postgres` exists only when `db_host` is empty, `caddy` only when
  `domain_name` is set — and the command runs `--remove-orphans`. So setting
  `use_rds`, or clearing `domain_name`, and then upgrading will **stop and remove**
  the local postgres or the TLS terminator. That is the intended outcome of those
  variables, but it happens on the upgrade rather than on `apply`. Data survives
  either way: both bind-mount under `/mnt/data`.

### Why the upgrade rewrites the compose file

`aws_instance` deliberately ignores `user_data` drift, so an instance keeps the
compose file it was created with. Compose passes only the variables named in a
service's `environment:` block into the container, so **a node setting added to
the template never reaches an existing instance** — writing it to
`/opt/gitlawb/.env` and restarting leaves the node on its built-in default, with
no error to indicate it. `pull && up -d` alone cannot fix that, because the file
on disk is the authoritative one.

Reinstalling the rendering first makes the upgrade a real migration. It is
idempotent: on an already-current instance it writes identical bytes.

Replace the instance itself (OS/AMI/instance-type changes) with
`terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.node` — the data volume reattaches and
`/data` (including the identity key) survives.

## Changing configuration

`terraform apply` alone never changes a running instance: user-data runs once and
the instance ignores `user_data` drift. How a change rolls out depends on which
of the two files carries it.

**Rendered into `compose.yaml`** — `image_tag`, `gitlawb_port`, `metrics_port`,
`domain_name`, `db_host`, the `icaptcha_*` values. `apply`, then run
`upgrade_command`: it installs the new rendering and restarts.

```sh
terraform apply
$(terraform output -raw upgrade_command)
```

**Written into `/opt/gitlawb/.env` at first boot** — `public_url`,
`bootstrap_peers`, `auto_sync`, `max_pack_bytes`, and the integration secrets.
Editing these in `terraform.tfvars` does **not** reach a running instance, because
nothing rewrites `.env` after the first boot. Either edit `/opt/gitlawb/.env` on
the instance and `docker compose up -d`, or replace it:

```sh
terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.node
```

The data volume reattaches; repos, postgres data, and the identity key survive.

**A node setting the installed `compose.yaml` does not already name** —
`GITLAWB_ENFORCE_OWNER_PUSH` on an instance created before it was added, for
example. Editing `.env` is **not enough**: compose only passes through the
variables its `environment:` block lists, so the value is read from `.env` and
then dropped. Run `apply` plus `upgrade_command` first, which installs a compose
file that names the key; after that, `.env` governs it like any other.

That last case is the one worth remembering: `.env` reaches the container only for
keys the *installed* compose interpolates, and the upgrade is what makes a newly
added key one of them.

## Remote state (optional)

Local state is the default. To move state to S3: create a versioned bucket,
uncomment the `backend "s3"` block in `versions.tf`, then:

```sh
terraform init -migrate-state
```

## Teardown

`terraform destroy` will **fail on the data volume by design**
(`prevent_destroy`). To tear everything down:

1. Back up the identity key (above) and take a final snapshot if you may return.
2. Remove the `prevent_destroy` line from `aws_ebs_volume.data` in `main.tf`.
3. `terraform destroy`.

Note: DLM snapshots created by the policy are not deleted by destroy — clean
them up in the EC2 console if unwanted. The Elastic IP is released on destroy.

## Security notes

- Postgres password: generated by Terraform, stored as an SSM SecureString,
  fetched at boot via the instance profile — never in user-data or state-free
  files on disk (only in `/opt/gitlawb/.env`, mode 600). It IS in Terraform
  state — treat state as sensitive (another reason for the S3 backend).
- Sensitive optional vars (`operator_private_key`, `pinata_jwt`,
  `s3_access_key_id`, `s3_secret_access_key`) follow the same SSM path.
- SSM secrets use the AWS-managed `aws/ssm` key by default; set
  `ssm_kms_key_id` to encrypt with a customer-managed KMS key instead (the
  instance role is granted `kms:Decrypt` on that key automatically).
- IMDSv2 is required; metrics port is closed unless `metrics_ingress_cidr` is set.
- The node itself serves plain HTTP on 7545. Set `domain_name` (with DNS
  pointing at the Elastic IP) to run a Caddy sidecar with automatic Let's
  Encrypt TLS on 443 (+ http→https redirect on 80) — matching the Fly nodes.
  Certs persist on the data volume (`/mnt/data/caddy`).
