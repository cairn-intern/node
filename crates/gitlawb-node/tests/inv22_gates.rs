//! #174 U6 — INV-22 completeness guard (rung-raising).
//!
//! INV-22: a permit held per op recovers only if every path that holds it is also
//! duration-bounded and reaps the process group before releasing admission, and every
//! detached git/blocking task carries its own admission. PR #174 fixed five paths
//! (U1-U5) that violated this. Each fix has a per-unit RED/GREEN regression; together
//! those form the five-revert matrix. This guard adds the missing piece: a source-scan
//! tripwire that fails when a NEW site reintroduces the class, or when one of the five
//! gates is removed.
//!
//! It lives in `tests/` (a separate crate) on purpose: a guard that scanned the same
//! file it lives in would match its own identifier literals and pass vacuously. Here
//! the scanned `src/` files never contain this file's literals, so each check is
//! load-bearing — reverting the named gate turns the assertion red.
//!
//! These are deliberately coarse structural checks, not a parser. They cannot prove a
//! gate is *correct* (the per-unit tests do that); they prove a gate is *present and
//! not bypassed*, which is what stops the class from silently regressing.
