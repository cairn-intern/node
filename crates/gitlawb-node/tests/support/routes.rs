//! U1: the deny-bearing route set for the invariant deny-prober.
//!
//! Every route that carries a runtime deny to assert lives here: owner-gate
//! (403), multi-principal (403), read-gate (404), signature-required (401), and
//! caller-self / actor (403): `SignerSelfGate` for the request-body field
//! bindings (create_task delegator, claim_task assignee, register did) and
//! `MultiPrincipalGate` with the assignee arm for the complete/fail actor gates.
//! The completeness cross-check in `deny_harness.rs` derives the caller-self set
//! from `src/api` and requires each `did_matches(caller, X)` handler to be a
//! driven row, so a new one cannot silently escape the sweep.
//!
//! Scope: this doc claims the REST/api surface only. The parallel GraphQL
//! mutation caller-self gates (`src/graphql/mutation.rs`) are out of this
//! harness and fenced separately (#219).
//!
//! Each row is classified by READING its handler, never inferred from the route
//! name, and records the handler fn name so a reviewer can spot-check. Guessing
//! is how a false test enters the sweep (the register_replica lesson: it looks
//! like an owner-gate, it is signer-self; and list_visibility is a 403
//! owner-gate despite being a GET).
//!
//! Rows are declarative (gate class + entities + reachability), not prebuilt
//! requests, so Flavor B (the cross-surface differential prober) can reuse them
//! (R9).
