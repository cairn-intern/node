//! U2: fixture state matrix + per-gate-class probe generators.
//!
//! The fixture is a STATE MATRIX, not one repo: owner-gate rows need a repo the
//! signed stranger can REACH (so the request hits the owner gate, not an
//! existence-hiding 404), and read-gate rows need a repo the caller CANNOT see.
//! A single repo cannot be both, so we seed a public repo (owner-gate substrate)
//! and a private repo with content (read-gate substrate).
//!
//! Each deny-bearing row expands to probes: the hostile request (asserting the
//! exact deny) plus a positive twin (owner-reachability for owner-gate,
//! reader/sibling-public read for read-gate) so a 403/404 for the wrong reason
//! cannot false-pass.
