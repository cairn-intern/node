//! Centralized repo storage layer — local disk cache backed by Tigris (S3).
//!
//! Every handler that needs access to a git repo on disk goes through `RepoStore`:
//!
//! - `acquire()` — ensures the repo is on local disk (downloads from Tigris on cache miss).
//! - `release_after_write()` — uploads the updated repo to Tigris after a write operation.
//! - `init()` — creates a new bare repo locally and uploads to Tigris.
//!
//! When Tigris is disabled (bucket empty), this is a simple passthrough to local disk.
