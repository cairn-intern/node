# image ships: cargo loads the whole workspace before it resolves anything, so a
# missing member's Cargo.toml (or a path dependency pointing at one) aborts the
# layer before a single crate is fetched.

# No `|| true`: this layer is expected to succeed, and swallowing its exit code
# is what let it sit dead from the moment gl gained a path dependency on
# icaptcha-client. A failure here should stop the build, not silently turn every
# image build into a cold one.
# gitlawb-node declares BOTH a [[bin]] and a [lib], so it needs both stubs:
# cargo resolves every declared target before it fetches anything, and a
# missing src/lib.rs aborts the layer with a target resolution error.

# Run under tini so the node is never PID 1. As PID 1 a process must reap
# reparented orphans itself; the node does not, so git's reparented grandchildren
# (e.g. pack-objects orphaned when a served upload-pack dies on a client
# disconnect) would accumulate as zombies until fork() fails with EAGAIN (#53).
# tini reaps them and forwards SIGTERM/SIGINT to the node, which runs its own
# graceful shutdown. (No `-g`: the node manages its own children, so group-wide
# signalling would only disturb in-flight git helpers during shutdown.)
